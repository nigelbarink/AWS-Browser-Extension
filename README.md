# AWS-in-plain-english
Translates AWS names to more human friendly names

## What is the general idea?
I got the idea to make this plugin after reading a blog post.
[Blog post](https://www.expeditedssl.com/aws-in-plain-english)

The blog post talks about how the AWS names often make no sense and how their naming of services
is often really confusing to their users.
In hopes of solving this problem the guy wrote down a bunch of alternative names for existing AWS services that make a bunch more sense.
I thought let's build a browser extension that replaces the names Amazon gives their service with an alternative one.
